        Pratap Singh I (c. 9 May 1540 – 19 January 1597), popularly known as
        Maharana Pratap (IPA: [məɦaːˈɾaːɳaː pɾəˈtaːp] ), was a king of Kingdom
        of Mewar, in north-western India in the present-day state of Rajasthan.
        He is notable for leading the Rajput resistance against the expansionist
        policy of the Mughal Emperor Akbar including the Battle of Haldighati
        and the Battle of Dewair. Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of
        Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh ascended to
        the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh. [5][6][7] His younger brothers
        were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two
        stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort was Ajabde
        Bai Punwar of Bijolia. [8] Their eldest son was Amar Singh I. [9] He
        belonged to the royal family of Mewar. [10] After the death of Udai
        Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed
        him[11] but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be
        their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended the
        throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the
        Sisodia Rajputs. [12] He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of
        Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies of
        Emperor Akbar. He was given the town of Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in
        return for his help Pratap Singh, gained distinction for his refusal to
        form any political alliance with the Mughal Empire and his resistance to
        Mughal domination. The conflicts between Pratap Singh and Akbar led to
        the Battle of Haldighati. The Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led
        to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals.
        However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom in the Aravalli range
        was still under the control of Maharana Pratap. Mughal Emperor Akbar was
        intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap
        Singh was crowned king (Maharana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of
        envoys, including one by Raja Man Singh I of Amer, entreating him to
        become a vassal like many other rulers in Rajputana. When Pratap refused
        to personally submit to Akbar and several attempts to diplomatically
        settle the issue failed, war became inevitable.[16][17] The forces of
        Pratap Singh and Mughal and Rajput general Man Singh met on 18 June 1576
        beyond a narrow mountain pass at Haldighati near Gogunda, modern day
        Rajsamand in Rajasthan. This came to be known as the Battle of
        Haldighati. Pratap Singh fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400
        Bhil archers. Man Singh commanded an army numbering around 10,000
        men.[18][19][20] After a fierce battle lasting more than three hours,
        Pratap found himself wounded and the day lost. He managed to retreat to
        the hills and lived to fight another day.[21] The Mughals were
        victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the forces of
        Mewar but failed to capture Maharana Pratap.[18][19][20] Haldighati was
        a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to kill or capture
        Pratap, or any of his close family members in Udaipur. [22] While the
        sources also claim that Pratap was able to make a successful escape, Man
        Singh managed to conquer Gogunda within a week after Haldighati then
        ended his campaign. Subsequently, Akbar himself led a sustained campaign
        against the Rana in September 1576, and soon, Gogunda, Udaipur, and
        Kumbhalgarh were all under Mughal control
